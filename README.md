# Installation

Visual Studio is a requirement to run the project. If you have computer using MacOS, Ubuntu, etc. you will not be able to run the project locally.

Since MSSql is being used, MSSQL 2017 is needed. You may check for installations;

After you installed Visual Studio properly, .sln file is enough to open the project. 

You need to update database path in FRC.Portal.Web>>Web.config (You will see my path there)
